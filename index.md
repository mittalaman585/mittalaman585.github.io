# **why to choose civil engineering**

**GoodMorning** all present here. I am Aman Mittal . I am from ludhiana,**PUNJAB**.I am pursuing Btech **Civil Engineering** from **GURU NANK DEV ENGEERING COLLEGE**.

WHY do i want to be a **Civil Engineer**.I did not know the answer myself. I was extremely confused when it came to choice carrer. There are so many field that
interested me that i found it difficult to make my mind. Then i read about **Civil Engineering**, an occupation the construction of roads, builidings and bridges. As a  looked further in **Civil Engineering**, i begin to like many aspects of this carrer. **Civil Engineering** plays a crucial role in the design, construction and maintainace of buildings.

Earlier i feel **Civil Engineering** is related with construction purpose but after reading it briefly my all myth got bursted. There are about 12 sub-branches in  **Civil Engineering**

From  above sub-branches **STRUCTURE ENGINEERING** is myfavourite one

# **Structural Engineering**

Structural engineering is a sub-discipline of civil engineering in which structural engineers are trained to design the 'bones and muscles' that create the form and shape of man made structures. Structural engineers need to understand and calculate the stability, strength and rigidity of built structures for buildings and nonbuilding structures.  They can also be involved in the design of machinery, medical equipment, and vehicles where structural integrity affects functioning and safety.

These factors pushed me to become a civil engineer myself and I guess I am on the path to be what I always wanted to become that is a CIVIL ENGINEER.
